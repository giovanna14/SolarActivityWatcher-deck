## Observing the Sun

Observations of the Sun are carried out continuously from
space to study the solar structure and activity.  

The ESA/NASA mission <a href="http://sohowww.nascom.nasa.gov/">SOHO</a> (Solar and Heliospheric Observatory)
was launched in 1995 and continues to collect data through 
various instruments. 

These data help experts predict "space weather"
events such as magnetic storms that may affect human activities
on Earth.

We consider the following instruments:

1. <a href="http://umbra.nascom.nasa.gov/eit/">EIT</a> is the Extreme
Ultraviolet imaging Telescope and provides images of the Sun at wavelengths
171, 195, 284, and 304 Angstrom.

2. <a href="http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/index.php">LASCO</a> is the
Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronograph Experiment and provides
images of the solar corona through 2 telescopes (C2 and C3). The
view of the Sun itself is blocked.

## Solar Activity Watcher - a Shinyapp

Solar Activity Watcher is a web-app based on 
RStudio's Shiny package and hosted on the Shiny server:
<a href=
"https://giovanna-temporin.shinyapps.io/Solar_activity_watcher">Solar_activity_watcher</a>. 
It acts as a user interface for
accessing data products distributed through the SOHO 
archive and the web-site of the LASCO team.

### SOHO latest images of the Sun

On the side-panel, the user selects 1 to 6 possible EIT and/or
LASCO latest images and hits the `Submit request` button.

The app calculates an HTML archive request for 
each selected image name, downloads the images and displays them on the main panel.

For example, if the user selects `EIT 284`, the following archive request is calculated:

```{r image request,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,results='asis'}
imagedata <- function(){
              images <- "EIT 284"
# definitions for SOHO latest images
              url1 <- "http://ssa.esac.esa.int/ssa/aio/product-action?RETRIEVALTYPE=LATEST_POSTCARD&FILTER="
              url2 <- "&INSTRUMENT="
              url3 <- "&RESOLUTION=512"
              ext <- ".jpg"
#
              nIma <- length(images)
              list <- sapply(images, strsplit, split=" ")
              m <- matrix(unlist(list),ncol=2,byrow=TRUE)
              instr <- m[,1]
              filter <- m[,2]
              url <- paste0(url1,filter,url2,instr,url3)
              return(url)
}
imagedata()
```

### Daily movies of the solar corona

The user selects from the calendar on the side-panel
a date for the LASCO daily movies to be displayed. 

The app calculates the URL of the movies based on the date, downloads them
and displays them on the main panel. 

For example, for yesterday's 
date the following movie URLs are calculated:

```{r movie URLs,echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE,results='asis'}
library(shiny)
library(lubridate)
movie <- function(){
# get yesterday's date
    day <- today()-1
# definitions for LASCO movies
    mnames <- c("movieC2","movieC3")
    movieext <- ".mpg"
    x1 <- unlist(strsplit(as.character(day),"\\-"))
    x2 <- unlist(strsplit(
                        as.character(format(
                              day,format="%y-%m-%d")),"\\-"))
# 4-digits year, 2-digits month and day
    yyyy <- x1[1]; mm <- x1[2]; dd <- x1[3]
# 2-digits year
    yy <- x2[1]
# create temporary names for files to be downloaded to www directory
	  movienames <- tempfile(paste0(yy,mm,dd,mnames),tmpdir="www",movieext)
           
    movieC2URL <- paste0("http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/daily_mpg/",
                          yy,mm,dd,"_c2.mpg")
    movieC3URL <- paste0("http://lasco-www.nrl.navy.mil/daily_mpg/",
                          yy,mm,dd,"_c3.mpg")
    movieURL <- c(movieC2URL,movieC3URL)
    return(movieURL)
}
movie()
```
